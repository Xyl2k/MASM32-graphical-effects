# MASM32 graphical effects code collection

More than 50 various graphical effects mostly in GDI, collected from the warez scene.\
This collection is mixed with codes written by their respective coders and some have been ripped/rewritten by passionates people.\
Credits go to the authors.\

## Deployment

To compile you will need to install the [MASM32 SDK](https://www.masm32.com/)\
We provide also a [WinASM](https://www.winasm.org/) project file for each effects.\
All the demos can be compiled at once using `make-all.bat` or from their respective `make.bat` if you don't want to launch your favorite IDE or install WinASM.

## Contributing

Contributions to this repository are welcome, please first discuss the change/additions you wish to make via issue, email, or any other method with the owners of this repository before making any changes.\
Please avoid unnecessary/superflux code and keep it to the minimum: the graphical effects. We are not looking for full templates with music, GFX (expect if texture is needed), serial key algorithm, etc...
